## What is Polyphon?

Polyphon is a desktop application for orchestrating conversations between multiple AI voices simultaneously. You send a message — and every voice responds. Voices can read each other's replies and build on them, creating a genuine multi-agent dialogue.

The name comes from *polyphony* — many voices in harmony. You are the conductor. The AI models are the ensemble.

## Key Features

### Multiple voices, one conversation

Add any combination of voices to a session — Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, or local CLI tools like `claude` or `codex`. Every voice sees the full conversation history, including what other voices have said.

### Compositions

Save a named set of voices as a **composition**, then launch new sessions from it instantly. Configure each voice's model, system prompt, and tone independently.

### API and CLI voices

Polyphon supports three kinds of voices:

- **API voices** — communicate with a remote model using your own API key (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini)
- **CLI voices** — spawn and communicate with a local CLI tool as a subprocess (`claude`, `codex`, `copilot`)
- **Custom voices** — user-defined OpenAI-compatible endpoints (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, custom proxies)

All types behave identically inside a session.

### Broadcast and conductor modes

Choose how your message reaches the voices:

- **Broadcast** — your message goes to all voices simultaneously
- **Conductor** — direct your message to a specific voice

### Continuation rounds

Set a voice to automatically continue responding after each round, enabling back-and-forth between voices without manual prompts.

### Tones and system prompt templates

Shape how each voice communicates with **tone presets** — professional, collaborative, concise, exploratory, or teaching. Create custom tones and assign them per voice or set a global default in your Conductor Profile.

Save reusable **system prompt templates** and attach them to any voice in any composition. Update a template once and it applies to every new session that uses it.

### Conductor profile

Tell the voices who you are. Set your name, pronouns, background context, and preferred default tone. Every voice receives this context in its system prompt automatically.

### Local-first, no telemetry

Your conversations and API keys stay on your machine. Polyphon never phones home. There is no account, no cloud sync, no usage tracking unless you explicitly opt in.
