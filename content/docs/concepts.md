Polyphon uses a small set of specific terms consistently throughout the application. Understanding them makes everything else click.

## Voice

A **voice** is a single AI participant in a session. Each voice has:

- A **provider** (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, or a CLI tool)
- A **model** (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `gpt-4o`, `gemini-2.0-flash`)
- An optional **display name** — how it identifies itself in the conversation
- An optional **avatar icon** — a small emoji or symbol shown beside voice messages in the feed
- A **color** — used to visually distinguish voice messages in the feed
- An optional **system prompt** that shapes its personality or role
- A **tone** preset — professional, collaborative, concise, exploratory, or teaching

Voices are not global. They exist within a session or composition. The same provider can appear as multiple voices with different configurations.

---

## Composition

A **composition** is a saved, named set of voices. Think of it as a reusable template for a type of conversation.

For example, you might have a composition called *"Code Review Panel"* with three voices: a security reviewer, a performance optimizer, and a readability critic. Start a new session from that composition whenever you want all three perspectives.

Compositions can be created from the sidebar and launched as many times as you like. Each launch creates a new independent session.

## Session

A **session** is a live conversation thread. It has:

- A set of voices (either from a composition or configured ad-hoc)
- A message history
- A mode: **broadcast** or **conductor-directed**

Sessions are persistent — they are saved to your local database and can be resumed. Archived sessions are hidden from the sidebar but not deleted.

## Round

A **round** is one full cycle of all voices responding. When you send a message, Polyphon dispatches it to all active voices. Once every voice has finished generating its response, one round is complete.

With continuation enabled (see below), voices can automatically trigger additional rounds, allowing voices to build on each other without you sending another message.

---

## Continuation Policy

The **continuation policy** controls what happens after the first round completes. It is set at the composition level in the Composition Builder, and applies only in broadcast mode. There are three options:

- **None** — voices respond once and wait. No further rounds start automatically.
- **Prompt me** — after each round, a nudge banner appears asking whether you want to continue. Click **Allow** to start the next round or **Dismiss** to stop.
- **Auto** — voices continue responding automatically for up to the configured number of rounds (1–3). A "Max rounds" slider sets the limit.

The continuation nudge (used in "Prompt me" mode) appears as an amber banner between rounds in the session view.

See [Compositions](../compositions/#continuation-policy) for how to configure this and [Sessions](../sessions/#continuation-rounds) for how it looks during a session.

## Broadcast vs. Conductor-Directed Mode

### Broadcast mode

Your message is sent to **all voices simultaneously**. This is the default. Use it when you want every voice to weigh in on the same question.

### Conductor-directed mode

You can direct your message to a **specific voice**. The other voices see the exchange but only the targeted voice responds. Use this when you want to follow up with one voice without interrupting the others.

---

## API Voices vs. CLI Voices

Polyphon supports two categories of voice providers:

**API voices** connect to a cloud model using an API key you provide. The request goes over the network to Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google's servers. API voices can be granted access to [filesystem tools](../tools/) — host-brokered operations like reading files, listing directories, running commands, and fetching URLs. These are enabled per-voice in the Composition Builder and optionally sandboxed to the session working directory.

**CLI voices** spawn a local subprocess — a command-line tool already installed on your machine (like the `claude` or `codex` CLI). No additional API key is needed beyond what the CLI tool itself uses. Everything runs locally. CLI voices run as autonomous agents and manage their own file access — Polyphon's filesystem tools do not apply to them.

Both types are treated identically inside a session. You can mix them freely in a composition.

The Composition Builder shows whether each voice type is available based on your current configuration. If an API key is not configured, the API type button is disabled. If the CLI binary is not found in your PATH, the CLI type button is disabled. This prevents adding a voice that would fail when a session starts.

---

## Custom Providers

A **custom provider** is a user-defined OpenAI-compatible API endpoint — such as a local Ollama instance, LM Studio, or a private model proxy. Custom providers are configured once in **Settings → Custom Providers** and then appear as voice options in the Composition Builder alongside built-in providers. Inside a session, they participate in rounds the same way as built-in API voices.

See [Custom Providers](../custom-providers/) for setup instructions.

---

## Conductor Profile

The **conductor profile** is information about *you* that gets injected into every voice's system prompt. Set your name, pronouns, background context, avatar, and preferred default tone once — every voice in every session will know who it's talking to.

See [Conductor Profile](../conductor-profile/) for details.
