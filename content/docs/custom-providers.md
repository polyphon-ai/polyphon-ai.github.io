---

A **custom provider** is a user-defined voice endpoint that speaks the OpenAI API protocol. Any service that exposes an OpenAI-compatible API — Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, or a private proxy — can be added as a custom provider and used in compositions alongside built-in providers.

---

## When to Use a Custom Provider

- You are running a local model with Ollama or LM Studio and want to use it in Polyphon.
- You have a private inference endpoint (vLLM, custom proxy) that is not built into Polyphon.
- You want to use any OpenAI-API-compatible service without modifying Polyphon.

For built-in providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Claude CLI, Codex, Copilot), see [Voice Providers](../providers/) instead.

## Adding a Custom Provider

1. Go to **Settings → Custom Providers**.
2. Click **Add Custom Provider**.
3. Fill in the form:

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Name** | Yes | Display name shown in the UI (e.g. "Local Ollama") |
| **Slug** | Yes | URL-safe identifier, auto-generated from the name; read-only after creation |
| **Base URL** | Yes | The root URL of your OpenAI-compatible endpoint (e.g. `http://localhost:11434/v1`) |
| **API key env var** | No | The *name* of an environment variable that holds the API key for this endpoint. Leave blank if the endpoint requires no authentication. |
| **Default model** | No | Pre-selected model when adding a voice from this provider |

4. Click **Fetch Models** to retrieve the list of available models from the endpoint (requires the endpoint to be running).
5. Click **Save**.

## API Key Env Var

Custom providers do not accept a raw API key in the UI. Instead, enter the **name** of an environment variable that contains the key — for example, `MY_PRIVATE_KEY`. Polyphon reads the variable from your login shell environment at startup (the same way it resolves built-in provider keys).

If your endpoint requires no authentication (Ollama running locally with default settings), leave the field blank. The status badge on the provider card will show **"No API key required (auth-less endpoint)"**.

---

## Ollama Setup Example

[Ollama](https://ollama.com) runs large language models locally with no API key required.

1. [Install Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) and pull a model:

   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3.2
   ```

2. Start the Ollama server (runs automatically after install on macOS):

   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```

3. In Polyphon, go to **Settings → Custom Providers → Add Custom Provider**:
   - **Name:** Local Ollama
   - **Base URL:** `http://localhost:11434/v1`
   - **API key env var:** *(leave blank)*
   - **Default model:** `llama3.2`

4. Click **Fetch Models** to confirm Polyphon can reach the endpoint, then click **Save**.

## Editing and Removing Custom Providers

On any custom provider card in **Settings → Custom Providers**:

- Click **Edit** to update the name, base URL, API key env var, or default model. The slug cannot be changed after creation.
- Click **Delete** to remove the provider. Deletion is a soft-delete — the provider is hidden but voices in existing compositions that reference it continue to work in sessions already started.

---

## Using a Custom Provider Voice in the Composition Builder

Once a custom provider is added in Settings, it appears in the provider grid inside the Composition Builder alongside built-in providers. Click it to open the voice configuration form, then select a model and configure the voice as normal.

Custom provider voices are labelled **CUSTOM · API** in the provider grid.
