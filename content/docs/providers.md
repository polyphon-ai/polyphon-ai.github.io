---

Polyphon supports two categories of voice providers: **API voices** that communicate with a remote model using an API key, and **CLI voices** that spawn a local command-line tool as a subprocess.

**API voices** (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, and custom OpenAI-compatible providers) can be granted access to [filesystem tools](../tools/) — host-brokered file operations, command execution, and URL fetching that Polyphon executes on the model's behalf.

**CLI voices** run as autonomous subprocess agents with their own file access. Polyphon's filesystem tools do not apply to them.

## API Providers

### Anthropic (Claude)

**API key variable:** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `POLYPHON_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

**Available models:** Claude Opus 4.6, Claude Sonnet 4.6, Claude Haiku 4.5, and others

To configure:

1. Get an API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com).
2. In Polyphon, go to **Settings → Anthropic** and paste your API key.
3. Click **Test** to verify the key is working.

<!-- Prerequisites: Settings → Providers tab, Anthropic card expanded | Platform: any | Theme: any | Window: default -->

Alternatively, set the key in your shell environment (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`) as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Polyphon reads your login shell environment at startup, so keys set there are automatically picked up.

---

### OpenAI (GPT)

**API key variable:** `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `POLYPHON_OPENAI_API_KEY`

**Available models:** GPT-4o, GPT-4o Mini, and others

To configure:

1. Get an API key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com).
2. In Polyphon, go to **Settings → OpenAI** and paste your API key.
3. Click **Test** to verify.

---

### Google (Gemini)

**API key variable:** `GOOGLE_API_KEY` or `POLYPHON_GOOGLE_API_KEY`

**Available models:** Gemini 2.0 Flash, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and others

To configure:

1. Get an API key from [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com).
2. In Polyphon, go to **Settings → Google** and paste your API key.
3. Click **Test** to verify.

---

## CLI Providers

CLI voices run a local command-line tool as a subprocess. No additional API key configuration is needed in Polyphon — the CLI tool manages its own authentication.

### Claude CLI (`claude`)

The [Claude CLI](https://claude.ai/download) is Anthropic's official command-line interface.

**Requirement:** `claude` must be in your system `PATH` and authenticated.

To verify it is available:

```bash
claude --version
```

In Polyphon, go to **Settings → Claude CLI** and click **Test** to confirm Polyphon can find and invoke it.

### OpenAI Codex CLI (`codex`)

**Requirement:** `codex` must be in your system `PATH` and authenticated.

```bash
codex --version
```

---

### GitHub Copilot CLI (`copilot`)

**Requirement:** `copilot` must be in your system `PATH` and authenticated via the GitHub CLI.

```bash
gh copilot --version
```

---

## API Key Resolution

Polyphon resolves API keys in this order:

1. A provider-specific Polyphon variable (e.g. `POLYPHON_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)
2. The provider's canonical variable (e.g. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)
3. A key saved through the Settings UI

API keys are resolved in the **main process only** and never sent to the renderer or logged. The Settings page shows only a masked representation of the key.

---

## Checking Provider Status

The Settings page shows the status of every configured provider at a glance:

- **Available** — the key or CLI tool was found and tested successfully
- **Key found (untested)** — a key is present but has not been tested
- **Not configured** — no key or CLI tool found

## Custom OpenAI-Compatible Providers

In addition to the built-in providers above, Polyphon supports **custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints**. Use this to run local models with Ollama or LM Studio, connect to a private inference proxy, or use any service that exposes an OpenAI-compatible API — without modifying Polyphon.

Custom providers are configured in **Settings → Custom Providers**. Once added, they appear in the Composition Builder voice selector alongside the built-in providers listed above.

See [Custom Providers](../custom-providers/) for step-by-step setup instructions, including an Ollama example.
